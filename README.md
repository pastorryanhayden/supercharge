# Cloud Cannon Starter

*This is my starter file for jekyll/cloud-cannon projects.* 

Here is what is included:

- A base jekyll theme.
- Zurb foundation setup to work with Jekyll 
- Some configuration moved from _config.yml to _data/settings.yml and _data/design_settings.yml - this is so it can be user edited on a cloud cannon site.
- slideout.js - for vertical menus.
- slick.js for side scrolling image galleries.
- gulp for browser-reloading (just run `npm install` and then `gulp` to start a local server.
